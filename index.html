                <h2>🎯 Why I Joined the AltSchool School of Engineering Program</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        I joined the <strong>AltSchool School of Engineering</strong> program because I believe in the power of 
                        hands-on, structured, and industry-relevant education. AltSchool presents a unique opportunity to 
                        learn directly from seasoned professionals and to build practical experience in a collaborative 
                        learning environment. The flexibility of the program and its focus on real-world applications made 
                        it the perfect choice for someone like me who is eager to transition into a more specialized tech 
                        role while balancing work and family life.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        My primary goal for joining this program is to become well-equipped with the requisite knowledge 
                        and practical skills in <strong>Cloud Engineering and DevOps</strong>. I aim to master the tools, 
                        technologies, and best practices necessary to design, deploy, and manage scalable infrastructure. 
                        Ultimately, I intend to leverage these skills to pursue a senior-level career in Cloud and DevOps 
                        engineering, contributing meaningfully to tech-driven organizations and delivering solutions that 
                        solve complex infrastructure problems.
